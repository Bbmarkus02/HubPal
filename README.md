# HubPal.org Exec. Summary 
**Pioneering - This is the first time that any type of projects are platformized (comprehensively?) in the blockchain space, maybe even the first to be online, eva?!**<br>

Projects like individual contract work, from business services to supply contracts, to community to city to infrastructures and ...endless more. Why is this the first time? Because platformizing projects is darn complicated and complex, and especially decentralized, and tokenized. So ... we are giving each project its own platform with its own "projectAlice.hubpal.eth" ... using ENS, wallet/s, oracles, payments and financing (equity, funding) and much much more. We will continue post hackathon.

This may be the first such comprehensive platformization in Web 2 and Web 3 - because platformizing projects is darn complicated and complex as there are many components, variety of moving parts, and all the vagaries that happens in the "analog world".

We will first target users and projects in the blockchain-crypto space. Why? Because the devs and degens are the most important users or consumers. We have to win them first. That is where we have to work out the kinks, the value propositions, and look for where the HubPal<sup>™</sup> Projects-Payments-Platformizations (PPPx) solutions solves gpas, pain points, and opportunities.  
 
**HubPal<sup>™</sup> highlighed build-to @ ETHGlobal Hackathon: ENS, PayPal, ChainLink, Circle, Walrus.**<br> 

A tokenized comprehensive end-to-end project platform - propose, design and create; underwrite, finance; track, and manage; - featuring dynamic escrow-staking system using ENS domains (e.g., supplier.project.eth) to structure payments with the Chainlink oracles verifying the Web 2, real-world audits, while PayPal/PYUSD-Circle bridges fiat &amp and additionally featuring [the new Next UI](https://github.com/HalfHashd/NextUI-08.08.2025).

[ Readme: This HubPal project start* date-08.13. It evolved from 2 other project ideas - first was [the new Next UI](https://github.com/HalfHashd/NextUI-08.08.2025) and is being rolled into the currnet project; the second was [the "States-ing"](https://github.com/HalfHashd/States-ing-08.13.2025) with a focus on ENS and theGraph but on hold. *HubPal investigation-ideation started 4 years ago and is part of deep root analysis and investigation into the world's economic model where I deconstructed "everything" - money, debt, what decentralized finance is (clue: its among peers and peers dont have debt, and backed into Sharia Law based finance), and even what is our alphanumeric language. Thus, the platform has been richly ideated out. ]

# Title: Looking for help - devs, designers, degens to build this...

### HubPal<sup>™</sup> hackathon build core - this is what we will build out for the ethGlobal hackathon.
* **ENS + Chainlink Functions/Automation + PayPal (PYUSD)**
* **Walrus (sidecar storage):** store invoices/PoD media; put `sha256` + `walrus://id` on-chain.**
* **UI/UX designer for [the new Next UI](https://github.com/HalfHashd/NextUI-08.08.2025).**
* **Bonus points: Ch.ung dont code... not since failing Basic eons ago, and got PTSD, so have some heart and join me. We will continue this project, launch it, and take over ze world! This is the 1st of the 1000x10.com, 999 more/10 years to halfhash and set sail!**

# HubPal: Decentralized Project Platformization

**HubPal.org** | *ETHGlobal Hackathon, August 2025*

**HubPal** pioneers *project platformization*—the first Web3 solution to create, fund, and manage any project, from freelance gigs to infrastructure builds, with decentralized, tokenized workflows. Why groundbreaking? Platformizing projects is complex, with countless moving parts, especially in the analog world. HubPal simplifies this using blockchain primitives, targeting crypto devs and degens first to refine value propositions and solve real pain points.

Each project gets its own platform via ENS domains (e.g., `projectAlice.hubpal.eth`), with subnames (e.g., `supplierBob.projectAlice.hubpal.eth`) mapping to wallets and smart contracts. Built on Flow testnet, HubPal leverages:
- **ENS**: Hierarchical identities for projects, suppliers, and stakeholders, bridging Web2 DNS.
- **Chainlink Functions**: Verifies real-world triggers (e.g., Stripe invoices) for dynamic escrow releases.
- **PayPal & Circle**: Fiat/crypto payments (PYUSD/USDC) with gasless UX via Circle Paymaster.
- **Walrus**: Decentralized storage for project data (e.g., invoices, designs).
- **Hardhat**: Robust contract development and testing.

## MVP Scope
For the hackathon, we demo one project with 3 milestones (supplies, labor, delivery):
- Buyer stakes $500 in PYUSD/USDC via PayPal/Fern.
- Supplier submits invoice (Stripe/self-attested); Chainlink Functions triggers payout to `supplierBob.projectAlice.hubpal.eth`.
- Data stored on Walrus, linked via ENS. Deployed on Flow testnet with Hardhat.

## Why HubPal?
HubPal’s *Projects-Payments-Platformization (PPPx)* solves gaps: fragmented supply chains, high trust costs, and siloed identities. Our dynamic escrow-staking system releases funds only on verified milestones, blending Web2 usability (PayPal, Next UI) with Web3 trustlessness. We target blockchain users to iterate fast, then scale to all industries.

## Sponsors & Prizes
- **ENS** ($10,000): Subnames for project hierarchy ("Best Use of ENS," "L2 Primary Names").
- **Chainlink** ($6,000): Functions for invoice triggers ("Best CCIP/CCT").
- **PayPal** ($10,000): PYUSD for stakes ("Grand Prize," "Innovative Payment").
- **Circle** ($10,000): USDC gasless payments ("Multichain USDC," "Gasless Experience").
- **Walrus** ($4,000): Stores invoices/designs ("Best App Using Walrus").
- **Hardhat** ($5,000): Contract deployment ("Best Projects").

**License**: MIT + Commons Clause Restriction

**Post-Hackathon**: Expand to equity/funding, multi-chain via LayerZero, and broader Web2/Web3 adoption.

# **HubPal** — 2025-08-14

**Pioneering.** HubPal aims to be the **first comprehensive platformization of projects** in the blockchain space (and arguably online): a unified way to **propose → underwrite → finance → execute → track** any project, end-to-end.

**What that means.** Projects—from individual contract work and business services to community, city, and infrastructure builds—are notoriously hard to “platformize,” especially when **decentralized and tokenized**. HubPal gives each project its **own mini-platform** under ENS, e.g. **`projectAlice.hubpal.eth`**, with **subnames** (e.g., `supplier.projectAlice.hubpal.eth`) for roles, routing, milestones, and payments. It binds together **ENS, wallets, oracles, tokenization, fiat/stablecoin rails**, and more. We’ll keep building post-hackathon.

**Why this is new.** Platformizing projects is **complex**: many components, many moving parts, and all the vagaries of the **analog world**. HubPal stitches these into one coherent UX that works across **Web2 + Web3**.

**Initial focus.** We’ll start with **blockchain/crypto projects**. Developers and degens are the most critical early users; we’ll prove value, smooth the kinks, and find where **HubPal™ Projects-Payments-Platformization (PPPx)** closes gaps, removes pain points, and opens opportunities.

**ETHGlobal Hackathon (build highlights).**
- **ENS** — project identity + role subnames  
- **Chainlink** — functions/oracles for milestone proofs & triggers  
- **PayPal (incl. PYUSD)** & **Circle (USDC)** — fiat↔stablecoin payments  
- **Walrus** — sidecar storage for invoices / proofs-of-delivery  
- **NextUI** — modern front-end

**One-liner.** A **tokenized, end-to-end project platform**—propose, design, underwrite, finance, track, and manage—featuring **dynamic escrow/staking** tied to **ENS domains** (e.g., `supplier.project.eth`), **Chainlink-verified** Web2/real-world checks, and **PayPal/PYUSD + Circle** bridging fiat and crypto. *(MIT License + Commons Clause Restriction.)*

## HubPal<sup>™</sup> Hackathon Fit-Check: Easiest Add-ons from Sponsors

### LayerZero — _Omnichain state mirror_
* **Why:** Qualify for the **Best Omnichain Interaction** prize.
* **Hook:** On each milestone release, push a message to a mirror contract on a second chain. This logs the state change across chains.

    ```solidity
    releaseLog(projectId, milestoneId, proofHash);
    ```

### Circle — USDC Power-ups
* **CCTP v2:** Offer merchants "desired chain" payouts. The escrow is on one chain (e.g., Base), but the payment is delivered in USDC on the merchant's preferred chain.
* **Paymaster:** Let users pay gas fees in USDC, creating a smoother user experience by removing the need for native tokens.
* **Gateway (testnet):** Use this to give users a single USDC balance, enabling a chain-abstracted checkout experience.

### ENS — Prize Alignment
* **Best use of ENS:** Use milestone subnames (e.g., `2.supplier-alice.project.eth`), store Walrus URIs in ENS text records, and use CCIP-Read for L2 resolution.
* **L2 Primary Names:** Set reverse records on a supported L2 (Base, Optimism, Linea, or Arbitrum) for all project participants.

### Hardhat 3 — Tooling Prize
* **Why:** Hardhat is the standard for Solidity development. You're already using Solidity, so building and testing with Hardhat is a natural fit.
* **Hook:** Build and test your project with Hardhat 3. Include well-documented scripts and a clean README for your code.

### Dynamic or Privy — Embedded Wallets
* **Why:** These services can help you compete for "Best Consumer App" prizes by providing dead-simple onboarding. Users (suppliers and buyers) don't need to be crypto-native.
* **Hook:** Integrate embedded wallets with social or passkey login. Allow users to fund their accounts with PayPal/PYUSD or USDC.

### Lit Protocol (Vincent) — Delegation & Safety Rails
* **Why:** This adds a governance and operational layer to your project.
* **Hook:** Create a "Vincent Policy" that governs agent actions. For example, a policy could state: "An agent may call `requestRelease(milestoneId)` only if the oracle proof hash matches on-chain and the action is taken before a specific deadline."

### Walrus — Storage Prize
* **App use:** Build a feature for uploading invoices and proof-of-delivery documents (`invoice.json` / `deliveryProof.jpg`) to Walrus. Store the file hash on-chain for verification.
* **Dev tool angle:** Create a small Command Line Interface (CLI) that uploads files to Walrus and prints the `{ hash, uri }` to be used in continuous integration (CI) workflows.
