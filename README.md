# ProjPlatformPaymentsPal-08.14.25
ENS-PayPal Staked Commerce @ ETHGlobal Hackathon: A decentralized escrow system using ENS domains (e.g., supplier.project.eth) to structure payments. Chainlink oracles verify real-world milestones, while PayPal/PYUSD bridges fiat &amp; crypto. Enables transparent, performance-based supply chain finance.

Looking for partners to build this (per GPT-5)
Hackathon fit-check (copy-paste)
Core (you already chose)
ENS + Chainlink Functions/Automation + PayPal (PYUSD)

Walrus (sidecar storage): store invoices/PoD media; put sha256 + walrus://id on-chain.

Easiest add-ons from sponsors (minimal friction)
LayerZero (Omnichain state mirror)
Why: Qualify for Best Omnichain Interaction.

Hook: On each milestone release, push a message to a mirror contract on a 2nd chain:

solidity
Copy
Edit
releaseLog(projectId, milestoneId, proofHash);
APIs: OApp send/receive (push), lzRead (pull), Composer (chained calls).

Circle (USDC power-ups)
CCTP v2: Offer merchant “desired chain” payouts; escrow on Base, deliver USDC on merchant’s chain.

Paymaster: Let users pay gas in USDC (smoother UX).

Gateway (testnet): Single USDC balance, chain-abstracted checkout.

ENS prize alignment
Best use of ENS: Milestone subnames (2.supplier-alice.project.eth), ENS text records for Walrus URIs, CCIP-Read for L2 resolution.

L2 Primary Names: Set reverse record on Base/OP/Linea/Arbitrum for all participants.

Hardhat 3 (tooling prize)
Why: You’re using Solidity anyway.

Hook: Build & test with Hardhat 3; include scripts + clean README.

Dynamic or Privy (embedded wallets)
Why: “Best Consumer App” style prizes; dead-simple onboarding for suppliers/buyers with no wallets.

Hook: Embedded wallets + social/passkey login; fund with PayPal/PYUSD or USDC.

Lit Protocol (Vincent delegation)
Why: Governance/ops flair.

Hook: Create a Vincent Policy:

“Agent may call requestRelease(milestoneId) only if oracle proof hash matches on-chain and before deadline.”

Enables human-approved, policy-scoped agent actions.

Walrus (storage prize)
App use: Upload invoice.json / deliveryProof.jpg to Walrus; store hash on-chain.

Dev tool angle: Tiny CLI that uploads to Walrus and prints { hash, uri } for CI.

Thank you.
